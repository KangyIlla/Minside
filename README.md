This project is a star wars database that displays movies and <br>
characters from star wars. I have used the api from [https://swapi.co/api/].<br>

I have also used bootstrap for styling.<br>
To run the program enter npm run when you are inside the project in the terminal.<br>

In this assignment it was also mentioned that you should use the uio-git.<br>
But I used my own github profile. I hope that is OK.<br>

The project contains a 3 different pages. The first one is a main page.<br> Which contains to buttons which leads you to either
movies or characters.<br> There is also a navbar which you can use 
to navigate.<br> The other is a page that displays movie titles and
some other relevant information.<br>Here I have used fetch to get alle the movies from the api.<br> The last one displays character.<br> Here I have also implemented paging and also used a modal to display detailed information about the characters.<br>
Here I have also used fetch, but I had to do fetch multiple times to<br>
get all characters, therefore I used do while loop.



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
